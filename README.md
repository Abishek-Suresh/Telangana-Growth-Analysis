 ### I had the privilege to join the Telangana Growth Analysis Resume Project Challenge 7. Telangana's government partnered with the codebasics team to extract valuable insights from their official open data portal for a brighter future.

 ### Peter Pandey is an aspiring data analyst looking for a project with real-time data to add to his portfolio. He wanted to analyze Telanganaâ€™s growth among different sectors quantitatively and provide valuable Insights to the Telangana government that would help them make data-informed decisions that would further support the state's growth.

 ### Imagining myself as Peter Pandey, I've created this Dashboard, crushing numbers and facts to make Telangana a better place. I've explored these data, Estamp Registration, Document Registration, Transportation(Vehicle sales data) and TS-Ipass to create meaningful visualization in order to help the stakeholders.

### Insights and Recommendation (My Findings):
  - Estamp Revenue surpassed the document registration revenue since its launch exhibiting a positive trend and, therefore can be a potential dominant in the upcoming days.

 	**Recommendation**: The government should try to promote Estamp challans and their benefits further, it has a high revenue-generating capacity.


  - Rangareddy, Hyderabad and Medchal Malkajgiri top in all three analysis, indicating that it has the best infrastructure and symbolizes economic growth overall.

    **Recommendation**: These three districts alone generate a good amount of revenue, therefore further investment and development strategies can be followed making them the strongest revenue-generating districts for Telangana.


  -  Certain sectors experience higher investments during particular months, for example, we can see that Vehicle sales skyrocketed in the month of October. 
	
	   **Recommendation**: Such times can be utilized by companies so that they can attract their customers by promoting discounts and new innovations in their respective sectors.

  -   We can see that the sales of Electric Vehicles increase gradually, particularly in FY 2022. Electric vehicles are more efficient, and that combined with the electricity cost means that charging an electric vehicle is cheaper than filling petrol.

	    **Recommendation**: The government can promote Electric vehicles by providing subsidies and other attractive benefits. Building charging stations across the districts. 


-   Low revenue-generating districts such as Mulugu, Warangal and Kumurambheem Asifabad should be noted and necessary measures should be taken to increase their revenue-generating capacity.

	  **Recommendation**: Implementing strategies such as taking a survey to understand what is lacking and what needs improvement. Assigning task forces to improve the infrastructure of those districts etc.
